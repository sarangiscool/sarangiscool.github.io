Zomato currently does not have a feature to order from multiple resautants at the same time. I lead a team of 5 where we tried to solve this problem with a very simple yet elegant solution.

We gathered UX feedback from users, created product personas, designed initial wireframes for a highly UX friendly user flow to optimize the ordering process [Check figma file here](https://www.figma.com/file/CwlQYdI9HCxIy0Inwyh55O/Group-Project-1?node-id=2%3A3)
