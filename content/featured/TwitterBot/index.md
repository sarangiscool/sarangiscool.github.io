Worked on Anomaly Detection in Videos project, funded by Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). 
Worked on object tracking using Open CV and python to implement algorithms using google colaboratory and used Gait analysis to detect abnormal behaviour in way a human walks.
Currently involved in dvelopment of complex Deep Learning models can detect and localize anomaly events with greater accuracy than the existing solutions.
