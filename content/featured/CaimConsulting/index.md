This was the FIRST APP I DESIGNED.
</br> The idea is that this youtuber is starting a dedicated platform for their community that has all the content, updates, products and topics around their channel so our goal as a team of designers was to design the app (iOS) + a one pager website (landing page) that communicates the value of the app to people.
