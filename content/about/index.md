Hello! I am a UI/UX designer who knows how to code. I am a student studying Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) who shares a deep interest in problem solving</br> and leading teams to reach product goals.
 <b> </br>I create, scale, and optimize product portfolios that matter.</b> To accomplish this, I focus on key results, collaborate with amazing teams, and quickly adapt to new insights.

I can successfully create, scale, and optimize software product portfolios.
- I put the customer at the center of all that I do.
- I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints.
</br>
- My gut instinct is good but I seek data for my decisions.
- I focus on making high-quality decisions.



If not working, you can find me volunteering for NGOs or playing with street dogs. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new perspectives. Reach out to me if you want to talk to me about products, user psychology, blockchain or music :)
