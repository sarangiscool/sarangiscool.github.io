- Worked on Anomaly Detection in Videos project, funded by [Korea Institute of Science and Technology](https://eng.kist.re.kr/kist_eng/main/) (KIST) under guidance of professor [D P Dogra](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile.php/dpdogra/).
- Developing anomaly event detection in surveillance videos was our goal and we worked on a generalized model to detect such abnormal events. 
- Worked on object tracking using [Open CV](/#work) and python to implement algorithms using [google colaboratory](/#work) and used Gait analysis to detect
 abnormal behaviour in way a human walks.
- In the current scenario, the development of <b>complex Deep Learning models</b> can detect and localize anomaly events with greater accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art techniques.
