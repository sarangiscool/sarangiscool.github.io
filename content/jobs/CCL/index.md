- I have been freelancing on and off as a product designer. I have built everything from low fidelity wireframes to high fidelity prototypes for clients based in India, USA and UK.
- A feature for one of my group based application design was appreciated by folks at [Unacademy](https://unacademy.com/), Bangalore.
- I also did a Machine Learning Internship by Verzeo where I worked on huge datasets of the gaming apps in playstore and used relevant models to gain valuable insights.
